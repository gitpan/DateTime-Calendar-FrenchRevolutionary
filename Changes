Revision history for Perl extension DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary.

0.07  Duodi 22 Fructidor CCXII, jour de la noisette (Tuesday 2004-09-07)
        - I used to believe that a capturing split would allow for one set
        of capturing parentheses which would capture the whole delimiter.
        My knowledge of Perl is fixed, together with the on_date method
        and the _load_event subroutine.
        - Add _raw_feast private method.
        - Add several methods for compatibility with DateTime: day_of_week,
        wday, dow, week_number.
        - Add the %{method} specifier for strftime
        - In the Locale::xx modules, add some methods for compatibility with 
        DateTime::Locale: month_names, am_pms, day_names, full_date_format, etc.
        - Still more propaganda in the on_date method
        - Insert empty lines in the on_date method, so the today example script
        can now wrap the text
        - The "ce_jour" method is removed, use the "on_date" method with 
        a parameter set to "fr" instead.
        - Check the few possible values for the locale and the time-zone.
        - Add a few tests.
        - The eg/result directory contains the year 213 calendar now.
        INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
        - The decimal equivalent of the 1..12 clock is the 1..10 clock, 
        not 1..5. This is because it represents the numbers printed on clockfaces.
        - The decade method returns a 2-element list, just like DateTime's
        week method. And by the way, the decade method is aliased to week.

0.06  Septidi 27 Frimaire CCXII, jour du liège (Wednesday 2003-12-17)
	- add test for nanoseconds... and fixed nanosecond related bug
	- add basic support for Locale, with two languages: French and English
	- add much more shameless propaganda for the French Revolutionary armies

0.05  Décadi 30 Fructidor CCXI, jour du panier (Tuesday 2003-09-16)
	- removed the reference to Makefile.PL in README
	- pod fixes thanks to Iain Truskett
	- add minimal support for nanoseconds (so conversion Greg->FR->Greg will not
	lose the precision)
	- add much stuff for the events that occurred in Vendémiaire
	- replace the CCXI calendars by CCXII calendars in the eg/result directory.

0.04  Primidi 11 Thermidor CCXI, jour du panis (Tuesday 2003-07-29)
	- the _offset_from_local_time was unduly commented out. Fixed.
	- removed Makefile.PL. Or rather, replaced by a file suggesting that
	the user adopts Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

0.03  Primidi 11 Floréal CCXI, jour de la rhubarbe (Wednesday 2003-04-30)
	- I had forgotten the Roman.pm prerequisite in Makefile.PL. Fixed.
	- A few words about Roman.pm in README, too.

0.02  Décadi 10 Floréal CCXI, jour du rateau (Tuesday 2003-04-29)
        - altered Makefile.PL so the existence of Build.PL will not cause problems.
	- negative dates (prior to 22 September 1792): I do not know whether
	they give proper results (year 0? leap year?) but at least you can
	convert back to Gregorian and get the same result.
	- added a few tests and examples

0.01  Nonidi 9 Floréal CCXI, jour de la jacinthe (Monday 2003-04-28)
        - initial version.

Revision history for Perl extension Date::Convert::French_Rev.

0.05  Nonidi 9 Floréal CCXI, jour de la jacinthe (Monday 2003-04-28)
        - last version compatible with Date::Convert, next one will
        be in the DateTime::Calendar namespace, compatible with DateTime.pm
        - I had always believed that the additional days were not called
        Primidi, Duodi etc. But I have found a document where they are
        called Primidi etc. The bug in the module is fixed.

0.04  Tridi 13 Fructidor CCX, jour de l'épine-vinette (2002-08-30, Friday)
	- reorganise the directory structure along Matt Sergeant's tips
        - include the 4000-modulus rule for leap years (according to emacs-21.2)
        - reorganise the absolute -> FR conversion
	- rephrase the README file
	- add the  prerequisite for Date::Convert  in Makefile.PL (the
	use statement and the @ISA array are not sufficient)
        - add a few examples in the eg/ subdirectory
	- fix a few bugs: $_ was squashed by date_string, the month value
	was not controlled
	- compatibility with diagnostics-1.2

0.03  20 Thermidor CCIX (2001-08-07, Tuesday)
        - rewrite the Changes file, with proper dates
        - it seems that the 4th additional day should rather be "jour
	de l'opinion"
	- reformat the code

0.02  19 Prairial CCIX (2001-06-07, Thursday)
        - add the prerequisite for Roman.pm in Makefile.PL
        - extend the "SEE ALSO" section

0.01  4 Prairial CCIX (2001-05-23, Wednesday)
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.19
