DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary version 0.09
====================================================

DateTime::Calendar::FrenchRevolutionary is copyright (c) 2003,

This is  a companion module  to DateTime.pm. It implements  the French
Revolutionary calendar and decimal time.

INSTALLATION

The preferred way, which requires Module::Build, is:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

Note:  This module  uses  Roman.pm.   This is  an  old module  (1997),
released at a time when the Makefile.PL mantra was not always done. As
stated in this  module, it is installed by  "manually" copying it into
lib's proper subdirectory. Yet, it seems that Module::Build is able to
cope with such a situation.

Note to the users of old filesystems.

All  filenames  except  one  (the  most  important)  respect  the  8.3
convention  used by  MS-DOS.  If you  use  an old  filesystem such  as
MS-DOS's filesystem or  the old Unix filesystem with  a 14-char limit,
you should find how the name
  lib/DateTime/Calendar/FrenchRevolutionary.pm
has been mangled, rename it  to a name compatible with your filesystem
and replace  all occurrences of the  string "FrenchRevolutionary" with
the new name in all files, including MANIFEST.

ALTERNATE INSTALL

This module can be installed on a perl-less computer!

All you need, on this computer, is:
  - tar and gzip, or compatible software
  - a table-aware HTML browser (no Internet connection required if you
  downloaded the archive from a local network or a CD-ROM)
  - a printer.

The installation steps are:

- Gunzip and untar the archive.
- Go to the eg/result subdirectory.
- Open the various files ending in "en.html" (or, if you are a
French-speaker, ending in "fr.html") with the HTML browser.
- Print them.
That's all!
