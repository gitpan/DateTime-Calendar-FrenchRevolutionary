DateTime/Calendar/FrenchRevolutionary version 0.03
==================================================

This is a companion module to DateTime.pm. It implements the French
Revolutionary calendar and decimal time.

INSTALLATION

The preferred way, which requires Module::Build, is:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

If Module::Build is not installed, you can still use the old way:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In   this  case,   the   Makefile.PL  script   renames  the   Build.PL
file.  Without this  precaution, the  make step  would try  to execute
Build.PL and fail.

Note:  This  module uses  Roman.pm.  This  is  an old  module  (1997),
released at a time when the Makefile.PL mantra was not always done. As
stated in this  module, it is installed by  "manually" copying it into
lib's proper subdirectory.  Do CPAN and CPANPLUS know that? I have not
(yet) tested.

Note to the users of old filesystems.

All  filenames  except  one  (the  most  important)  respect  the  8.3
convention  used by  MS-DOS.  If you  use  an old  filesystem such  as
MS-DOS's filesystem or  the old Unix filesystem with  a 14-char limit,
you should find how the name
  lib/DateTime/Calendar/FrenchRevolutionary.pm
has been mangled, rename it  to a name compatible with your filesystem
and replace  all occurrences of the  string "FrenchRevolutionary" with
the new name in all files, including MANIFEST.

ALTERNATE INSTALL

This module can be installed on a perl-less computer!

All you need, on this computer, is:
  - tar and gzip, or compatible software
  - a table-aware HTML browser (no Internet connection required if you
  downloaded the archive from a local network or a CD-ROM)
  - a printer.

The installation steps are:

- Gunzip and untar the archive.
- Go to the eg/result subdirectory.
- Open the various files ending in "en.html" (or, if you are a
French-speaker, ending in "fr.html") with the HTML browser.
- Print them.
That's all!
